# Zomato-python-project
This project marks my introduction to data analysis, where I utilized a Zomato dataset to extract meaningful insights. Leveraging Python, I performed various data queries to analyze patterns and trends within the dataset. This project helped me strengthen my skills in data manipulation, querying, and extracting actionable information from real-world data."
